Okay, so this was an app made with a team. It's pretty messy, and I definitely need to go back and finish some work on this. There's a lot of deprecated code, and it should probably be brought into react to improve performance. I also need to fully implement the optical image recognition and photo upload functionality that I never got around to actually making work due to time constraints. Overall, the app showed great promise, though.

If for whatever reason you'd like to run it, do an npm install and node server at the top level.
